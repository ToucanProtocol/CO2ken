# CO2ken

This is the original repository for [the CO2ken project](https://www.co2ken.io/).
**It is now obsolete, and has been superseded by a complete rewrite which will be released soon.**

However, we will leave it here for reference purposes.

## Contents

- [Smart contracts formerly at the heart of CO2ken](Contracts/contracts/) and their corresponding [ABIs](Contracts/abis/)
- [Files](DAO/) relating to setup of the now superseded [CarbonDAO](http://dao.co2ken.io/).
- [Files](Graph/) relating to setup of the now superseded [CO2ken subgraph of The Graph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/benesjan/co2ken)
- [Prototype of a reimplementation of the old frontend in Wordpress](wordpress/)

There are a few other bits and pieces but they should almost certainly be ignored.
